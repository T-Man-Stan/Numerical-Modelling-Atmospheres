# Numerical-Modelling-Atmospheres
Repository of various projects modelling changes to temperature and climate ranging from geo-engineering to different degrees of parameter complexity (e.g. timesteps, varying amounts of water, distance from the sun, number of layers of the atmosphere, composition of the atmosphere, etc)
